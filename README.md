# REALTIME-RALLY-TRACKING-SYSTEM-FOR-BLUEBAND-SPORTS
**ABSTRACT**

This project presents a real-time rally tracking system for Blueband Sports Organization, which is a key promoter of the Indian Rally Championship. This project is a Real-Time Rally Tracker that helps enhance safety, coordination, and real-time monitoring in rally events.. The system is designed using the Maduino Zero 4G LTE hardware, integrating GPS and GPRS for continuous location updates. It features SOS and OK buttons for emergency alert and status reporting during the rally. This information is communicated to the coordinators through a web user interface. A website was developed exclusively to track vehicles in real time, utilizing Next.js for the front-end design, along with Google Maps API, Google Cloud and Express.js. Additionally, this system can identify the route travelled by rally cars within a predefined path. It ensures reliable communication and accurate tracking throughout the rally.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In rally racing, vehicle tracking is a major challenge. Rally cars operate in off-road and high-speed environments, often in remote areas where maintaining coordination is difficult. Safety is a top priority—organizers must know the real-time position of every vehicle to respond to emergencies. For performance monitoring, teams need accurate speed, distance, and status updates. Traditionally, tracking relied on manual communication, but this has limitations in terms of accuracy and responsiveness.
To solve this, we developed a real-time vehicle tracking system using GPS and GPRS communication, integrating it with a web-based dashboard where organizers can monitor live data, vehicle locations, and emergency alerts. The system is now in the deployment phase with 80 tracking units being produced for Blueband Sports Organization.

**TECHNOLOGY AND HARDWARE USED**

For the hardware, we selected the Maduino Zero 4G LTE board, which is a compact yet powerful development board integrating:
The Maduino Zero 4G LTE is a powerful IoT development board that combines the ATSAMD21 microcontroller with the SIM7600E 4G LTE module, making it ideal for real-time GPS tracking, remote monitoring, and IoT applications.
